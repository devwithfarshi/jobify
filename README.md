# Jobify

**Project Overview:**  
Jobify is a comprehensive web application designed for admin users to efficiently manage companies and their associated job listings. Key features of the application include:

- **Role-Based Authentication:** Secure login system that distinguishes between admin and super-admin users.
- **User Management:** Super-admins can create, update, delete, and manage admin accounts.
- **Company & Job Management:** Admins can add, update, delete, and view companies and job listings, with advanced filtering, searching, and sorting capabilities.
- **AI-Powered Features:** Integration of AI technology for generating job descriptions and candidate outreach messages based on specified parameters (e.g., company, role).
- **Robust Pagination:** Implementation of pagination with optimized queries and lazy loading for enhanced performance.
- **State Management:** Utilization of Redux for effective state management throughout the application.

Jobify is developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), providing a modern, efficient, and scalable solution for job management.
